# URL-Classification
In spite of all the advantages it provides, the internet has become a platform used for 
online crimes today. These offenses are committed through URLs. My goal in this project is to identify and 
classify malicious URLs and develop an ML algorithm that can alert users to potential threats in advance.
I used URL dataset (ISCX-URL-2016) from Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. You can reach dataset using this url: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html


I collected all the codes into URLclassification.ipynb you are free use my codes :)
